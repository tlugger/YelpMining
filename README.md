## Project
Mining data from the Yelp Dataset Challenge. Building an accurate model to classify and predict Yelp user behavior and predict user ratings dependent on weather. 

## Questions Answered
* Can we predict User Behavior based on the dataset?
  * Yes but we can most accurately predict low ratings over high ratings.
* Do outside forces beyond a restaurants control such as weather conditions affect Yelp User ratings?
  * Possibly. Our results provide motivation to investigate this further.

## Applications
 * Produce a better predictive model based off of the Yelp data for businesses to gage their future health. 
 * Assist restaurants in knowing when to prepare for cusotmers in a bad mood.
   * Couponing before poor weather conditions
